                <!-- Detailed background information about education and experience -->
                <p>I am a Computer Engineering graduate from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana. My academic background in computer engineering has provided me with a strong foundation in both hardware and software systems. This comprehensive education has equipped me with a deep understanding of computer architecture, programming principles, and system design. My experience at KNUST has not only enhanced my technical skills but also developed my problem-solving abilities and analytical thinking, which are crucial for my current pursuit in backend engineering at Alt School.</p>
